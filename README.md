# Predicting the Price of USed Cars

## IMPORTANCE OF THE TOPIC CHOSEN:

* Buying and Selling: One of the primary reasons for predicting the price of used cars is to help buyers and sellers determine a fair price for a vehicle. Buyers can use the predicted price to make an informed decision about whether or not to purchase a particular car, while sellers can use it to set a reasonable price for the vehicle they are selling.

* Financing: If you are planning to buy a used car through financing, the predicted price can help determine the loan amount and the interest rate. It is important to have a fair estimate of the car's value before agreeing on a loan, as this can affect the interest rate and the monthly payment.

* Insurance: Insurance companies often use the predicted value of a car to determine the insurance premiums. The higher the predicted value of the car, the higher the insurance premium.

* Maintenance and Repairs: The predicted price of a used car can also provide insight into the expected cost of maintenance and repairs. Older cars with higher predicted prices are likely to require more maintenance and repairs, while newer cars with lower predicted prices may have fewer issues.

In summary, predicting the price of used cars is essential for making informed decisions about buying, selling, financing, insuring, and maintaining a vehicle.

## PROJECT 

In this project, we intend to predict the price of used cars based on their features like transmission, mileage, fuel type, tax, mpg, engineSize.

1.  Importing the data.
2.  EDA (Descriptive Statistics on the data, Checking for Missing Values, Handling null Values and duplicate Values, Correlation Matrix(Heat Map))
3.  Data Cleaning
4.  Visualisations included : Boxplots, Pair Plots, Scatterplots, Cat Plots.
5.  Data Preparation for modelling (Removing Features, Feature Engineering techniques like One-Hot Encoding, Standardizing Data, Splitting into train and test data)
6.  Modeling (Regression Models : Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, KNN)
7.  Making predictions, comparing with actual test data, evaluating using R2 score, RMSE scores.
8.  Comparing different model performances and then chossing the most effective one.
